    <!-- performed text -->
    <pre>
            This is
            performed text.
            It preserves    both spaces
            and line breaks and shows the text in a monospace font.
        </pre>

    <p>The pre tag is good for displaying computer code:</p>

    <pre>
            for i = 1 to 10
                print i
            next i
        </pre>
